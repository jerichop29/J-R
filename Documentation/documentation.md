## üîê Access Control

All data access must be preceded by **user authentication**:

- The system checks for a valid `username` and `password` in the `users` collection.
- Based on the `type` (e.g., `"Admin"`), the system grants read/write access to `about`, `members`, `projects`, and `skills`.
- Users with limited roles (e.g., `"Guest"`) may only have read access.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Personal/team overview (`About`)
- Member profiles with avatars and bios
- Showcase of past projects with images and descriptions
- Skillset gallery with icons
- User authentication and role-based access

---

## üîß Technologies

- Backend Database: **MongoDB**
- Backend Framework: *(optional)* Node.js, Express.js
- Frontend: *(optional)* React / Vue / Flutter Web
- Authentication: Basic username/password auth or JWT

---

## üìÇ File Uploads

All uploaded assets (avatars, project images, CVs, icons) are stored in the `/uploads/` directory and referenced by file path in the database.

---

## üìç Notes

- This system follows a **NoSQL design** with **manual references** only.
- There is no enforced schema relationship; logic-based access is controlled via application layer.
- You can extend the `projects` collection to reference `members` or `skills` by storing their ObjectIds or names.

---

## ‚úÖ Future Enhancements

- JWT-based authentication
- Search and filter functionality for projects/skills
- Admin dashboard for CRUD operations
- Role-based UI rendering
